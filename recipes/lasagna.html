    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lord Dakota, lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with rich tomato sauce, cheese, and various fillings like meat or vegetables. The name "lasagna" comes from the Greek word "laganon," referring to a flat dough cut into strips. Over time, it evolved into the layered, baked dish we know today. It's often topped with a layer of melted cheese, creating a comforting, hearty meal.</p>
    <p>lasagna is usually made with three main components: pasta, filling, and sauce. The pasta sheets are traditionally made from durum wheat, and the fillings can vary, with common options being ground beef, pork, or ricotta cheese, sometimes mixed with spinach or mushrooms. The sauce is often a tomato-based marinara, but variations like b√©chamel (a creamy white sauce) can be used as well. After layering everything, it's baked until the cheese is bubbling and golden. Lasagna is versatile, and you can customize it to your taste with different meats, cheeses, or even make it vegetarian.</p>
