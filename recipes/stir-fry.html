    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Start by heating a tablespoon of oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add sliced vegetables like bell peppers, onions, broccoli, and carrots. Stir-fry for about 5-7 minutes until the veggies are tender-crisp. Add in your choice of protein, such as chicken, beef, or tofu, and cook until fully browned and cooked through.</p>
    <p>For the sauce, mix together soy sauce, garlic, ginger, a bit of honey or sugar, and a splash of vinegar or lime juice. Pour the sauce over the cooked ingredients in the pan and toss everything to coat. Let it cook for another 2-3 minutes until everything is well combined and the sauce thickens. Serve your stir-fry with steamed rice or noodles for a quick and delicious meal.</p>
